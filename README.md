# Aidoku / Tachiyomi Backup Reader

This is a small, **unrefined** app that can visualize Aidoku (and to an extent Tachiyomi) backups online.

Sadly there is no Tachiyomi to Paperback converter that uses tachiyomi's new .tachibk/.proto.gz extension as well as Paperback's new .pas4 archive format currently and I don't have time to build a proper one at the moment.

A workaround (albeit manual) is to use [bdashore3's](https://github.com/bdashore3) [Tachiyomi to Aidoku tool](https://github.com/bdashore3/Tenkan) to convert Tachiyomi to a different format, and then pass that into this tool which can assist in visualizing as well as marking them off while manually migrating to Paperback.

### Notes
There are 'Default' and 'Unknown' are categories for manga that have no set category or are broken, respectively.
